# software-engineering-topics

This is a list of topics for engineers looking for their next thing to learn. A big problem in learning is not
know what you don't know. This lack of know "what you don't know" slows down your learning. If instead we could
hand beginners a laundry list of topics they could direct their learning and allocate enough time. This list is
an attempt to catalog topics by career path and difficulty. Contributions welcome.
